Our add-on provides the privacy essentials you need to seamlessly take control of your personal information, no matter where the Internet takes you: tracker blocking, smarter encryption, DuckDuckGo private search and more.","fullDescription":"Privacy, simplified.\n\nProtecting your privacy online is like protecting your home. Locking the front door won’t stop the most determined folks from getting inside, especially if you’ve left the back door and windows unlocked and an extra key under the doormat. That’s why we offer multiple types of privacy protection, most of which aren’t offered in most popular browsers by default.\n\nWith the press of a button, you get seamless protection from most 3rd-party trackers while you search and browse, access to tracking protections for emails you receive, and much more. Together these privacy essentials make more privacy your default.\n\nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\n\n    Search Privately by Default— DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.\n    Escape Website Trackers Before They Load— automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using (e.g. sale, ads, etc.) any data from these trackers. Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology — called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes well above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default.\n    Automatically Enforce Encryption — force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. Most popular browsers only direct users to encrypted versions of pages in specific circumstances, like when you navigate directly to a page in the address bar. We check our list of upgradable sites for all links you click.\n    Enable Built-in Email Protection — Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.\n    Escape Fingerprinting — help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings.\n    Block Tracking Cookies— prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.\n\n\nADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS NOT AVAILABLE ON MOST BROWSERS\n\n    Link Tracking Protection — helps stop companies from gathering your browsing history and other information via personal identifiers embedded in the links you click on.\n    Embedded Social Content Tracking Protection — blocks embedded Facebook content around the web so they can't track you through their videos, posts, and comments found on other sites. You can easily unblock to view them if desired.\n    Google AMP Protection — forces sites to load content directly from publishers instead of using Google-owned links, which are full of creepy trackers.\n    Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) — built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\n\nNote about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.\n\nRead more about this and our Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections/\n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy.

Stylus supports installs from popular online repositories. Additionally, styles can now also be installed from .user.css or .user.styl URLs (see Usercss format documentation in our github wiki).\n* A backup feature for your entire database of installed styles, which is compatible with other user-style managers.\n* An intuitive and configurable automatic update function for installed styles.\n* A highly customisable UI, including theming, optional layouts, icon and badge colour choices, along with many other tweaks.\n* Two different optional code validators with user configurable rules.\n\nUseful Links\n\n* Source code: https://github.com/openstyles/stylus\n* Video tutorial: https://youtu.be/fCVvGwoF5cQ\n* Chat room: https://discord.gg/tzXVNJz\n* Frequently asked questions: https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ\n* Technical bug report: https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues\n* General discussion and bug report: https://add0n.com/stylus.html#reviews\n* Localisation: https://www.transifex.com/github-7/Stylus/dashboard/\n\nPermissions\n\nStylus uses only a small subset of each permission. As you can see in WebExtensions API documentation or simplified tutorials, there's no way to apply any modifications to a web page without gaining the full access permission to that page. Stylus is mostly used to apply global themes, which is why it requests a global permission. In the future we might be able to implement a more granular approach but it's not exactly trivial.\n\n* Access your data for all websites - required for the style elements to be added into the page, not to access any of your data.\n* Access browser tabs - required to show styles in the popup, and for some auxiliary features like regexp tester in the editor.\n* Access browser activity during navigation - required to insert the styles at the exact moment the page is navigated to a different URL.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nUnlike other similar extensions, we don't find you all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Full stop.\n\nFirefox related notes\n\n* To import styles from the Stylish add-on, please read https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus\n* Stylus doesn't apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there's no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don't plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround.

You can easily set custom \"user-agent\" strings from the toolbar popup\n2. The extension uses a two-factor technique to mimic your default \"user-agent\" string, which is the most reliable method\n3. The extension does not use any resources when it is not spoofing the user-agent\n4. The extension enables user-agent spoofing on specific domains only; it is conversely possible to exclude certain domains from spoofing. Check the Options page for more info.\n5. You can set per-site user-agent strings\n6. There is an option to randomize user-agent strings.\n7. It is possible to set user-agent string for a single window; you can have a separate user-agent string for each browser window\n\nSupported operating systems:\nWindows, Mac OS, Linux, Chromium OS, Ubuntu, Debian, Android, iOS, AmigaOS, OpenBSD, BeOS, Haiku, Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD, Slackware, SUSE, gentoo, Fedora, Gentoo, Mageia, CentOS, Mint, DragonFly, Kubuntu, Mandriva, Zenwalk, Unix, GNU, OS/2, AIX, QNX, BEOS, RISC OS, Symbian, Nintendo, OpenSolaris, Kubuntu\n\nSupported browsers:\nInternet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, WebKit, Avant, Maxthon, Arora, Mozilla, Epiphany, Camino, Chimera, Chromium, Dragon, conkeror, Conkeror, Dillo, Links, Firebird, Swiftfox, Netscape, Flock, iCab, Iceape, icecat, IceCat, IceWeasel, Iron, Meleon, Konqueror, Lunascape, Lynx, MAXTHON, midori, Midori, KHTML, Mosaic, NetSurf, OmniWeb, Tablet, Mini, Phoenix, RockMelt, Safari, Browser, SeaMonkey, Slim, Webkit, w3m\n\nFor more info and general bug reports please use:\nhttps://add0n.com/useragent-switcher.html\n\nFor technical bug reports please use:\nhttps://github.com/ray-lothian/UserAgent-Switcher/","weeklyDownloads":7038,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Ray","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/13129494/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/188/188200.png?modified=1622132777","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/188/188200.jpg?modified=1622132777","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/202/202435.png?modified=1622132779","width":440,"height":280,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/202/202435.jpg?modified=1622132779","thumbnailWidth":440,"thumbnailHeight":280}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/addondonation/10usd?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.3144,"reviewCount":180,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/user-agent-string-switcher/reviews/","updateDate":1671837708000},{"id":"extension@tabliss.io","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/850/850407-32.png?modified=1650892013","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/850/850407-64.png?modified=1650892013","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/850/850407-128.png?modified=1650892013"},"name":"Tabliss - New Tab","version":"2.6.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3940751/tabliss-2.6.0.xpi","homepageURL":"https://tabliss.io","supportURL":"https://tabliss.io/support.html","description":"A beautiful New Tab page with many customisable backgrounds and widgets that does not require any permissions.","fullDescription":"Transform your new tab page to something beautiful and yours.

We don’t—and will never—monitor or collect any logs of your online activity.\n\n✔️ AUDITED BY CURE53 TO GUARANTEE SECURITY\nSurfshark is one of the few VPN providers to have gone through an independent auditing process by cybersecurity experts Cure53. We’ve also received an AV-Test Seal of Approval from the independent German Cybersecurity Institute.\n\n\nUseful info & links:\n\nHelp is available 24/7 via live chat on our website or support@surfshark.com\nWarrant canary: https://surfshark.com/warrant-canary\nPrivacy Policy: https://surfshark.com/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://surfshark.com/terms-of-service","weeklyDownloads":4055,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Surfshark","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/13932238/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/257/257340.png?modified=1622641366","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/257/257340.jpg?modified=1622641366","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Surfshark VPN - Protect your device with Surfshark VPN"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/257/257341.png?modified=1622641365","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/257/257341.jpg?modified=1622641365","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Surfshark VPN - Access geo-blocked content"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/257/257342.png?modified=1622641365","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/257/257342.jpg?modified=1622641365","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Surfshark VPN - Secure your digital life"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/257/257343.png?modified=1622641365","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/257/257343.jpg?modified=1622641365","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Surfshark VPN - Recommended by experts"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/257/257344.png?modified=1622641364","width":920,"height":680,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/257/257344.jpg?modified=1622641364","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":394,"caption":"Surfshark VPN - Secure your digital life"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":3.4859,"reviewCount":210,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/surfshark-vpn-proxy/reviews/","updateDate":1673432215000},{"id":"{5b1a796b-231a-4ad1-84ff-918db0818207}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2697/2697795-32.png?modified=d46630b5","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2697/2697795-64.png?modified=d46630b5","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2697/2697795-128.png?modified=d46630b5"},"name":"Startpage Privacy Protection","version":"1.1.5","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4029071/startpage_privacy_protection-1.1.5.xpi","homepageURL":"https://www.startpage.com","supportURL":"https://support.startpage.com","description":"By installing the free Startpage Privacy Protection extension you will be able to stop trackers and cookies and set Startpage as your default search engine.","fullDescription":"Startpage Privacy Protection extension provides private search and online data protection.

After this time, the chat will be marked as real if no spam behavior is detected.\n\nThe settings are saved in the cloud and you can access them by clicking on the extension icon in your browser toolbar.\n\nClicking the anti-spam button while it's enabled temporarily disables the module for the current chat.\n\nYour conversation is never saved, shared or sent to any server, do not worry!\n\nIf you have any ideas for improvement, feel free to contact me at the provided email!","weeklyDownloads":119,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Undefined","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/14182664/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/265/265162.png?modified=1641406765","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/265/265162.jpg?modified=1641406765","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"extension
