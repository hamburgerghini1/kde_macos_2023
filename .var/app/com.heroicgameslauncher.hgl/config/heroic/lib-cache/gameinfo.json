Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Ethan’s home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into.\n\nInspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the early twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private detective and quite a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not an especially puzzle-ridden game. **_Our focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity of our characters._**\n\nStill, the discoveries won’t happen on their own, or without your help. Using both Paul’s supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the dead, and your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery behind a trail of corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red Creek Valley, and the fate of a missing boy.\n\n![EGS_TheVanishingofEthanCarter_TheAstronauts_G2_01](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/egs-thevanishingofethancarter-theastronauts-g2-01-1920x736-e23c61dd370c.jpg)\n\n# Key Features\n\n-  **Explore and interact with the beautiful yet ominous world of Red Creek Valley**, created with the use of revolutionary photogrammetry technology.\n\n-  **Communicate with the dead and see how they died in order to gather clues** that help you piece together the truth.\n\n- **Experience, in non-linear fashion, a story that combines the pleasures of pulp, private eye, and horror fiction.**\n\n- **Conduct the investigation on your own terms and at your own pace.** The game contains no combat of any kind, and a few scary bits in the game are less about terror and more about clammy unease.",

A Box of Matches...\n\nDie, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each with its own power and suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation.\n\nWith a limited supply of matches to light your way and darkness encroaching, can you find your way through the fog to reveal the truth? Or will you be engulfed by the secrets this town doesn’t want you to know?\n\n# Game Features\n\n- The village structure changes each time all your characters die\n- Discover characters' special abilities, use tools and consumables to open shortcuts\n- Keep narrative and puzzle progress across game-overs (_roguelite_)\n- Manage your supply of matches to help your sight and solve puzzles\n- Non-linear progression, dynamic and adaptive narrative\n- Investigate the ritual at the heart of the game and use what you find to stop it\n- Puzzles deeply integrated with the game world and narrative (not abstract)\n- Artwork and animations inspired by stop-motion and rotoscoping film techniques",

			"description": "Discover Aven Prime - an alien planet of deserts, tundras, and jungles light years from earth. Aven Colony puts you in charge of humanity's first extrasolar settlement, where you build and expand your small colonies into massive, sprawling cities while dealing with the challenges faced when settling on a new world.\n\nBuild your colony's infrastructure, look after the well-being of your citizens, manage your resources, and guide your colony to prosperity against the backdrop of the harsh and often dangerous realities of the exotic world of Aven Prime.\n\n# KEY FEATURES:\n\n**COLONIZE AN ALIEN WORLD:** Build a new home for humanity on a world with a low-oxygen atmosphere, extreme electrical storms, shard storms, dust devils, deadly toxic gas eruptions from geothermal vents, and days so long they have their own seasons. Explore a variety of biomes, from the lush wetlands environment to the much less habitable desert and arctic.\n\n**MEET THE LOCALS:** Encounter a variety of alien life forms, including giant sandworms, deadly plague spores, and a vicious fungal infection known as “The Creep.”\n\n**SUPERVISE YOUR COLONISTS:** Settling a new world can be stressful. As a new Colony Governor, you’ll need to work overtime to help your colonists deal with their new environment. Using the 12 distinct \"overlay\" modes, you can mange your colony's Crops, Citizens, Happiness, Crime, Air, Electricity, Employment, Resources, Commute, Structures, Drones, and Water. Earn the respect of your colonists, and rise in rank from Colony Governor to Expedition President!\n\n**DISCOVER THE PAST:** The world of Aven Prime holds many secrets. Play through a full single-player campaign and participate in a story that reveals some of the many secrets of this brave new world.\n\n**BUILD THE FUTURE:** Use construction drones to build dozens of types of structures to house your colonists, establish trading routes, welcome immigrants and much more! Enhance your existing buildings through several upgrade tiers to push your colony to new heights!\n\n**EXPEDITION SYSTEM:** Deploy your crack team of pioneers to explore alien ruins, recover artifacts, repair crashed vessels and rescue lost explorers. Get ready to take on plague and creep spore nests whilst fending off splinter groups, rebels and Aven Prime's remaining robot guardians which threaten your new civilisation.\n\n**PREPARE FOR WINTER:** A fully functional day/night and seasonal cycle. During the winter Aven Prime freezes over - farms will not grow food and solar panels will generate far less electricity. Take measures to survive this harsh climate!",

Craft increasingly useful items with the blueprints, gadgets and tools on board the station to overcome dangerous obstacles in your way. Survive unprecedented threats with your wits and ability to improvise.\n\n## Prey: Mooncrash\nFight overwhelming odds to escape a secret TranStar moon base where the enemies you encounter, the hazards you face, the goals you complete, and the loot you collect are different each time you play. With changing environments as dangerous as they are dynamic, the Mooncrash campaign for Prey will offer a fun, infinitely replayable challenge to test even the most skilled players.\n\n## Story\nIn Prey: Mooncrash, TranStar’s secret moon base stopped transmitting shortly after the events of Prey. Now Peter, a hacker stationed aboard a spy satellite tasked with intercepting TranStar communications, must find out why. Trapped and under a ruthless contract with KASMA Corp, Peter’s only hope of ever seeing his family again is uncovering the moon base’s lost secrets.\n\n## Live. Die. Adapt. Escape!\nEscape TranStar’s moon base before the Typhon threat takes over. A simple goal, but one with hundreds of viable solutions. In Mooncrash, players will experience an all-new, infinitely replayable, ‘rogue-lite’ campaign with ever-changing enemies, weapons and objectives against a constantly increasing alien threat.\n\n## Survive How You Want with Who You Want\nUnlock multiple characters as you play, each with their own set of specialized, upgradable skills. Will you forge your path with the resourceful engineer Joan, trade that wrench in for Security Officer Bhatia and his shotgun, or will you choose the frail-but-gifted Andrius and his arsenal of psychic abilities? Prey is about choices, and those choices belong to you.\n\n## Search for Secrets, Loot…and a Way Off\nArkane Studios’ talent for detail and story-rich environments comes alive in Mooncrash. As you explore the station, which is the same size and scope of four levels of the original game’s Talos I station, don’t forget to keep your eyes peeled for precious supplies – and, of course, Mimics.\n\n## New Challenges, New Solutions\nThe Typhon threat has returned with familiar foes and tough new enemies, each armed with a unique set of deadly characteristics. Use the full power of the arsenal at your disposal, including popular weapons and abilities from Prey’s main game, to fight for your life and make a mad dash for your escape.",
